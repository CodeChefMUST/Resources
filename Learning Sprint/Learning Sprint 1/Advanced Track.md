## Day 1

**Topic: Fenwick Tree** 

It is a special data structure, usually represented using an "array".  - General Complexity, for Update & Query: O(log n), where n=Number of Elements of Array 

It is also called **"Binary Indexed Tree"**(BIT) (because of the logic in its implementation and how it works).

General/Basic application problems, which require Fenwick Tree and can’t be solved using  Brute Force Approach:

         Queries on Sum of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements,
  
         Queries on Product of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements, etc.

**Topic: Simple Segment Tree**  
It is a special data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively,  while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. 

**General Complexity, for Update & Query:** O(log n), where n=Number of Elements of Array  - Many complex as well as simple problems can be solved using Segment Tree, efficiently.

**General/Basic application problems, which require Segment Tree and can’t be solved using Brute Force Approach:** 

      Queries on Sum of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements,- 
      
      Queries on Product of Ranges [l,r] in an Array, with updates on ranges or elements, - etc.

**Fenwick Tree v/s Segment Tree**
Nearly every problem that can be solved using Fenwick Tree can be solved using Segment  Tree, but vice-versa isn’t true. 

But, since Fenwick Tree requires less memory as compared to Segment Tree, so, when the  "Memory Limit" for a problem is tight, try to solve the problem using Fenwick Tree. - Also, since Fenwick Tree is easier to implement, try, and use it over Segment Tree, where it is possible to use, to solve the problem.

## Day 2

**Suggestion:** Check out the Editorial of a Problem, only after trying and thinking  upon the Problem, for at least 1.5 hrs. Also, if you aren’t able to solve it and you check out the editorial, please do try to follow and understand the editorial’s approach and try & submit a solution to the problem. Don’t leave the problem,  without making a submission. (These are suggestions, for practice.) 


**Problem 1:** https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/fenwick-binary-indexed-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/help-ashu-1/description/ (Solve it using "Fenwick Tree" only) 


**Editorial 1:** https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/fenwick-binary-indexed-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/help-ashu-1/editorial/ 

**Problem 2:** https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/fenwick-binary-indexed-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/help-ashu-1/description/ (Solve it using "Segment Tree" only)
